# Grown Up Boy

*A Game Boy emulator built in `C++` for fun and learning.*

This emulator is a personal project focused on learning and experimentation. It is not guaranteed to be the most efficient or the most accurate implementation.


## Building
The project requires `CMake` and `SDL3` to compile.

For faster compilation, consider using `Ninja` as the build system.

### Windows

You can optionally use the following script to build the project:
``` batch
build.bat
```
### Linux

There is currently no automated build script for Linux, nor full assurance that the project can be compiled and run. However, I am working on it.
